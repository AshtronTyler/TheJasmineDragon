        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>

        <p>Our mission here at The Jasmine Dragon is to help reunite the four nations after this time of war and destruction. The Fire Nation has all but decimated The Four Nations and we would like to offer a place of peace and community. Let this be a place for people to gather and learn from one another as opposed to being divided from each other. We wish for this to be a place of knowledge, inclusivity, and happiness. In an effort to spread joy across the land, we are now offfering to deliver our tea leaves for those of you who cannot make the travel to Ba Sing Se. We hope this mission is enough to remedy the harm we have caused to you and yours and we will never stop fighting to bring peace and balance to The Four Nations.</p>

    <div id="regions">
        <h2>Regions</h2>
